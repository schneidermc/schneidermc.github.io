<p><b>I am currently a <a href="https://www.janelia.org/our-research/overview/theory-fellows">Computation & Theory Fellow</a> at <a href="http://janelia.org">HHMI Janelia Research Campus</a>.</b></p>
									
										
									<p>With a multidisciplinary background in mathematics and biophysics,
										the aim of my research is the development of theoretical concepts and analysis methods
										for biological data.
										The main focus of my current work is the development of machine learning methods
										for transforming images obtained from various imaging techniques (in particular, FIB-SEM and cryo-EM)
										into one another, with the aim of combining the unique advantages from each technique
										in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the true underlying cellular structures.
									</p>

									<p>Before joining Janelia, I worked as a postdoc at TU Wien, Austria, in the field
										of single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), where I also completed my PhD thesis
										in the Biophysics group of Gerhard Sch√ºtz.
										During this time, I advanced and developed new experimental and analytical strategies
										for studying oligomerization and nanoclustering of proteins via (cryo-)SMLM techniques.
									</p>

									<p>My interdisciplinary research has allowed me to gain broad experience collaborating
										with both theorists and experimentalists.
										Moreover, I am skilled at writing simulation and analysis software,
										and always striving to improve code performance, as well as (re-)usability.
										I am fascinated by the function of cells, from the single molecule level to
										the multi-cellular context in tissues and always eager to expand my skill set and expertise.
